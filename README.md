# Neurosymbolic-AI-Mocktail-Generator
The Neurosymbolic AI Mocktail Generator is a project aimed at generating mocktail recipes that are compatible and fit the user's profile using neurosymbolic AI. The project uses a dataset of mocktail recipes and user ratings, and combines symbolic reasoning as a rule-based system to remove all bad combinations of new mocktails generated, and a neural network trained on the remaining combinations to identify the best possible one.

Usage
The project starts by using a dataset of mocktail recipes and user ratings. This dataset serves as the foundation for generating new mocktails that will be compatible with the user's taste preferences.

The next step in the process involves symbolic reasoning as a rule-based system. This system is used to remove all bad combinations of new mocktails generated based on the dataset. The symbolic reasoning system is designed to identify and remove combinations of ingredients that do not match well based on the existing knowledge base.

After the rule-based system has removed all the bad combinations, the remaining combinations are then fed into a neural network. This neural network is trained on the remaining combinations to identify the best possible mocktail recipe for the user.

The final output of the project is a mocktail recipe that is generated based on the user's taste preferences and compatible ingredients. The result is a personalized mocktail recipe that is tailored to the user's preferred flavour profile, making it more likely that they will enjoy it.

It's important to note that the data and code for the project are only available in an ipynb file called 'neurosymbolic ai mocktail generator'. This file is a Jupyter Notebook that contains both the code for the project and the data used for training and testing the system.

Overall, this project combines the strengths of symbolic reasoning and machine learning to generate personalized mocktail recipes that are tailored to the user's taste preferences.
